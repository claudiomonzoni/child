            world’s largest publishing company, in the current context of a
            global crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, in which staying
            home is paramount to safeguard our health as well as our neighbor’s,
            has the pleasure to announce the opening of a call for children and
            teenagers, from all around the globe to participate in a
            one-of-a-kind quest to find the solo performers of the new original
            song to be included in the upcoming all-English album by the
            renowned musical group, “Zeke & The Kiddos”, entitled “The Musical
            Summit”.

            <span>
              Yes! Ezekiel Elkin, the founder and president of The Cultural

            To accomplish this, all interested songwriters must send in their
            original and unpublished songs –previously protected and registered
            at ASCAP or their respective authors and composers’ societies– by
            means of an online form by attaching a demo with a simplified
            arrangement and the lyrics. The songs must be written in one of the
            official languages of the country, nation, or people that the
            songwriter wants to represent and performed preferibly, but not
            necessarily, by a child.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the external songs are chosen by The Cultural Embassy’s
            Selection Committee, they shall be publicly announced on our website
            and our official social network accounts, indicating title, names of
            original songwriters, and country of representation. After this, the
            official “Zeke & The Kiddos” musical arranger, Gerardo Gardelín, an
            amazingly gifted Broadway musical director for Latin America, shall
            dress the said songs with his magical work. Elkin, also a masterful
            polyglot, will undertake the versioning of the foreign songs into
            English.

Right after, their songs shall be mixed and mastered in the United States of America for the subsequent album’s worldwide release. Depending on how the COVID-19 crisis unfurls and how economy evolves, a series of groundbreaking concerts could potencially follow.
